The Monte Carlo standard error of the mean is 0 (to two decimal places), indicating that the simulations have run long enough to estimate the posterior mean precisely.

The precise posterior distribution of $\\sigma$ can also be seen from the narrow range of the posterior quantiles. Finally, $\\hat{R}$ is near 1, telling us that the simulations from Stan’s four simulated chains have mixed well."

    "## Problems with the model and potential improvements\n",
    "The error term in the above model is a hack. It’s useful to allow the model not to fit the data perfectly, but it can’t be right to model these systematic errors as being independent. In this case, though, it doesn’t really matter, given how tiny these errors are: their estimated standard deviation is less than one percentage point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has two parameters that were fixed as data: `distance_tolerance`, which was set to 3 (implying that the ball will only fall into the hole if it is hit on a trajectory that would go past the hole, but no more than 3 feet past) and `overshot`, which was set to 1 (implying that the golfer will aim 1 foot past the hole). In theory it would be possible to estimate either or both these parameters from the data. In practice, no way. The model already fits the data so well (as shown by the above graph) that there’s clearly no more information available to estimate any additional parameters. If we were to do so, the estimates would be highly noisy and unstable (if their prior is weak) or highly dependent on the prior (if an informative prior distribution is specified). Either way we don’t see the advantage of this sort of fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just for laughs, though, we constructed such a model and fit it, just to see what would happen. We simply took our previous Stan program and moved these two parameters from the data block to the parameters block along with zero-boundary constraints:\n",
    "```\n",
    "real<lower=0> overshot;\n",
    "real<lower=0> distance_tolerance;\n",
    "```\n",
    "And then in the model block we added weak priors centered at Broadie’s guesses and with wide uncertainties:\n",
    "\n",
    "```  \n",
    "overshot ~ normal(1, 5);\n",
    "distance_tolerance ~ normal(3, 5);\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "Fitting this model to the data yields poor convergence and no real gain beyond the simpler version already fit in which overshot and distance_tolerance were set to fixed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is unrealistic in other ways, for example by assuming distance error is strictly proportional to distance aimed, and assuming independence of angular and distance errors. Presumably, angular error is higher for longer putts. Again, though, we can’t really investigate such things well using these data which are already such a good fit to the simple two-parameter model we have already fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Players vary in ability and golf courses vary in difficulty. Given more granular data, we should be able to fit a multilevel model allowing parameters to vary by player, golf course, and weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary of fitted models\n",
    "We have two datasets, `golf` and `golf_new`, to which we fit several Stan models. First we fit `golf_logistic` and `golf_angle` to the `golf` dataset, then we fit `golf_angle` to the `golf_new` dataset and see a problem, then we fit `golf_angle_distance_2` and `golf_angle_distance_3` to `golf_new` and finally obtained a good fit, then we fit `golf_angle_distance_3_with_resids` which was the same model but also saving residuals. Finally, we fit `golf_angle_distance_4` to `golf_new` but we didn’t display the fit, we just discussed it.\n",
